/**
 * The {@code Ship} class represents a ship in the game, with attributes such as
 * its type,
 * length, rotation, coordinates, and sections. It provides methods to
 * initialize a ship,
 * set its coordinates, and retrieve information about the ship.
 *
 * <p>
 * Ships can be of different types, including Destroyer, Cruiser, Submarine,
 * Battleship, and Carrier.
 * Each ship has a specific length and can be oriented in different rotations
 * (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
 * The ship is composed of ship sections, and each section has its own
 * coordinates.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example Usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Create a new Destroyer ship with default rotation (UP)
 * Ship destroyer = new Ship(Ship.ShipType.DESTROYER);
 *
 * // Set the coordinates of the ship at a specific location
 * destroyer.setCoords(3, 5);
 *
 * // Retrieve the ship sections of the destroyer
 * ArrayList<ShipSection> sections = destroyer.getShipSections();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>

 * @see Rotation
